# Minecraft wiki

College project from web development subject.

It's a small project to test my abilities with html, css, php and sql.

I just followed instructions from the file [Programacao Web - OK.pdf](https://github.com/AlNuN/minecraft-wiki/blob/main/Programacao%20Web%20-%20OK.pdf)

## How to run

This project was developed using LAMPP stack and a small php MVC framework made with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

You'll need to run it in a PHP server and have a MariaDB server running too.

The database data is saved at export.sql file.

## How to use the app
Once the application is running first you need to register a new user and then log with your credentials.

After that, you can log in and you'll be at the main menu.
There you can:
- Register a new block, as long its name isn't empty;
- Register a new recipe as long every block is registered;
- List all blocks;
- List all recipes and search them by its items;
- Check an external API for listing all items in the game.
